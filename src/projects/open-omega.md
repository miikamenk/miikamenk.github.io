I built these really cool Hi-Fi headphones designed by [DMS](https://www.youtube.com/@DMS3TV). Originally they were being manufactured and sold for $999 by him for a year, after which he open-sourced the whole project.
I ordered all the parts specified in the [BOM](https://github.com/DMS3tv/Open-Omega/blob/main/materials%20%26%20supplies) and printed all the files found in the [github](https://github.com/DMS3tv/Open-Omega) as well as a [headstrap and yokes](https://www.printables.com/model/1108653-capra-headband-v3/) made by Capra-Audio.

Overall it was a really cool project to build my own earphones and honestly they sound fantastic, the tuning by DMS was amazing and exactly as he said in his video, HD6xx with more bass. Amazing
