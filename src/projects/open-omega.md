These are really cool HIFI headphones designed by DMS. These were sold for about a year for 999$, and now he has open sourced the files on [github](https://github.com/DMS3tv/Open-Omega)

The headstrap is made by Capra-Audio, the files can be found on [printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1108653-capra-headband-v3/comments)
