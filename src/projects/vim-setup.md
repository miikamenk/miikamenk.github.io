This is my personal neovim setup, I have a lot of cool stuff added to it such as

- autocomplete
- code snippets
- image pasting
- markdown rendering
- obsidian note taking features
- a lot of different text editing features
- harpoon for quick switching between files
- git ui with lazygit
- and much more...
